# Weight vs Time

Weight vs Time is a strategic 2D side-scrolling game developed for a game jam with the theme "A Fragile Balance".  
You play as a penguin responsible for safely transporting eggs to a sled. However, you must balance between the weight of the eggs and the time remaining, as heavier eggs yield more points but take longer to retrieve.

The game offers three unique maps, each with different distances and time limits. Players must decide whether to collect closer, lighter eggs or venture farther to retrieve heavier, higher-scoring eggs.

Balancing time management and strategic decisions is essential to success.

## Features

- 2D side-scrolling perspective with strategic gameplay.
- Three distinct maps with unique layouts and time challenges.
- Two types of eggs: 5kg (closer, fewer points) and 10kg (farther, more points).
- Emphasis on balancing efficiency and score maximization.
- Cute protagonist and simple, fun visuals.

## How to Play

- Collect eggs from the designated boxes and deliver them to the sled.
- Eggs weigh 5kg or 10kg; heavier eggs are farther away but offer higher scores.
